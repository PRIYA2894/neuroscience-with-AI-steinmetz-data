Summary: The Steinmetz Neural Dataset

The Steinmetz dataset holds information about rodent brains. Scientists gathered this data through experiments to learn how brain cells work when rodents see, move, or think. Using this data, we created models that can predict how rodents' brains will react in different situations, based on recordings from any brain region. This helps us understand how the brain works and controls behaviors, like a glimpse into its inner workings.


# Conclusion 
1. Identifying Neural Correlations: Our analysis has revealed a significant correlation between neural firing patterns in the midbrain and thalamus. This correlation underscores the intricate relationship between these two regions and hints at their coordinated involvement in processing sensory information.

2. Enhancing Model Performance: Our investigation into training models for distinct brain regions has yielded intriguing insights. Notably, we observed that training a model on brain regions specific to an individual session led to notably higher accuracy compared to a model trained on combined brain regions across all sessions. This finding underscores the importance of session-specific neural nuances in improving the predictive capabilities of our models.
